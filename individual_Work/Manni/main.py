* assignment: we are working with a restaurant and we wanna make an app for them that takes the employeeâ€™s availabilities
and makes a schedule
* algorithm should be in Python
* make an algorithm that takes the availabilities of the employees from the DB or user input and makes a schedule out
of them where there is no overlapping things going on
