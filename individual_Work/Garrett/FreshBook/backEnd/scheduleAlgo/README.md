So this algorithm right now, takes in availabilities from how many ever employees you input are working in the restaurant.

It then takes each availability and puts it into the schedule list.

What is left to do -- take info from the database instead of inputing values yourself.

What also needs to be implemented -- take the info and avoid conflicts which will make an actual schedule and not overlap schedules.
